    <h1>A Surprise Visitor</h1>
    <h2>By: Marty Ho</h2>
    <p id="article">
      I was at home when I finished my <span class="click">homework</span>.
      After that I went to <span class="click">play soccer</span>. After a <span class="click">millisecond</span>
      the <span class="click">doorbell</span> rang. My <span class="click">mom</span> said, "I think your <span class="click">friend</span>
      is here, you guys have a <span class="click">play date</span>?"

      But when I <span class="click">opened the door</span>, it was a massive <span class="click">monster</span>!
      He broke the whole front porch and he looked like his weight
      was <span class="click">one million tons</span>! I called "Mom, what is this guy?"
      When I walked outside he was <span class="click">8 trillion</span> miles high
      (bigger than <span class="click">our planet</span>)
      and it made me <span class="click">gasp</span>. He looked like a <span class="click">zombie</span>!
      I quickly asked a <span class="click">question</span>,
      "A-A-Are you <span class="click">friendly</span>?" <span class="click">"I am going to kill you!"</span> said the <span class="click">dinosaur</span>.

      I was now <span class="click">really nervous</span>. I did not know <span class="click">what to do</span>. I tried to <span class="click">get
      home</span>. But in one nanosecond he <span class="click">grabbed me</span> and I <span class="click">kicked his hand</span>
      and then he released. Then I went home and got some <span class="click">scissors</span>!

      When I got out, I told the dinosaur to <span class="click">grabbed me</span> so
      he did. When he <span class="click">grabbed me</span>, I ran to his throat and he <span class="click">swallowed</span> me.
      I went through his <span class="click">pipe</span>, and when I got to his <span class="click">belly</span> I <span class="click">cut his throat</span> and
................................................................................<span class="click">NOTHING</span>.

      He just <span class="click">threw up</span> and <span class="click">spit me out</span>.
      Suddenly, he got stronger and angrier,
      so I <span class="click">ran</span> all the way <span class="click">into the woods</span> and found <span class="click">special secret</span> <span class="click">golden</span> <span class="click">weapons</span>.
      There was a <span class="click">spear</span>, <span class="click">nunchucks</span> and a super strong <span class="click">sword</span> and <span class="click">shield</span>. But
      there was a <span class="click">problem</span>. <span class="click">I didn't know</span> how to use them,
      except the shield and the sword.

      So I <span class="click">ran back</span> and saw the <span class="click">dinosour</span> and he had <span class="click">laser eyes</span>!
      We faught until
      someone was <span class="click">dead</span>. When I <span class="click">killed him</span>, I went back in the house to <span class="click">play soccer</span>.
      After a few minutes, my <span class="click">mom</span> asked, <span class="click">"How was your day?"</span> I said,
      <span class="click">"I don't know,"</span> because I didn't want to tell her. She would <span class="click">freak out</span>!
      After a few seconds...the <span class="click">door bell</span> rang.................................
      <span class="click">I opened the door</span>.......................................................
      It was the <span class="click">same thing</span>! So I walked back to <span class="click">play soccer</span>.
