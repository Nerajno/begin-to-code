# Lesson 1 Exercises

Please use Python Tutor to run each of these programs as you work on them.

## Write a Haiku

Write a program that prints a haiku. You will write your own haiku.
A haiku is a poem that has three lines.

* The first line must have 5 syllables.
* The second line must have 7 syllables.
* The third line must have 5 syllables.

## Hello, Sam I Am!

Write a program that first asks them what their first name is, then
asks them what their last name is, and then says a greeting to them based
on their name.

## Madlibs

Take this Madlibs game:

```
Python is a ______.
             noun
I ______ it because it is _____________.
   verb                    adjective 1
Compared to ________ it is more _____________.
             noun 2              adjective 2
```

Implement it as a Python program as was we did in the slides:

Use a variable assignment statement to create a variable for each placeholder,
and then use the print function to print out the sentences using both quoted
text (strings) and variables.

## Madlibs for Reals

Take the Madlibs game you made in the previous exercise, and instead of
setting the variables' values as literal string values, ask the user to enter
the values for every variable.

## Egg Calculator

It takes 2 eggs to make 5 pancakes. Ask the user how many pancakes they want
to make, and tell them how many eggs they need. Decimals are okay.

## Feet to meter

Ask the user how talk they are in feet, and then tell them how tall they are
in meters. Decimals are okay.

## Tip Calculator

The user just finished a meal at a restaurant. Ask the user for:

1. the amount of the bill
2. what percentage they want to add as a tip

and then tell them

1. the tip amount, and
2. the total amount.

## Coin Counter

The user has an assortment of coins: quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

Ask the user how many of each type of coin they have. Tell them the total
monetary amount of their coins.
