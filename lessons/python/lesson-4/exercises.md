# String Manipulation Exercises

## Level 1

1. Reverse a string: ask the user to enter a string and the print the reversed
version of the string.
2. Remove all vowels: ask the user to enter a sentence, and print their
sentence, except with all the vowels removed.
3. Convert to snake-case: ask the user to enter a sentence, and convert the
sentence to snake case. Given a sentence: "To be or not to be.", its snake case
should be: "to-be-or-not-to-be". Rules: are follows (do them in stages):
    1. replace spaces " " with dashes "-"
    2. lowercase all letters
    3. remove punctuation: ".", ",", "!"
4. Reverse the sentence: ask the user to enter a sentence, reverse its words.
Example: "to be or not to be" should be converted to "be to not or be to".
5. Triple the numbers: ask the user to enter a sentence,
triple each number in it. For example: "There are 3 bunches of bananas.
Each bunch has 5 bananas. How many bananas are there altogether?" is converted
to "There are 9 bunches of bananas.
Each bunch has 15 bananas. How many bananas are there altogether?"
You can assume a number only has one digit.
6. Like number 4, but instead of tripling the number, replace the number with
the English word of the number. For example, "There are 3 bunches of bananas.
Each bunch has 5 bananas. How many bananas are there altogether?" should be
converted to "There are three bunches of bananas.
Each bunch has five bananas. How many bananas are there altogether?"

## Level 2

7. Reverse the words: ask the user to enter a sentence, reverse the letters of
each of its words. Example: "to be or not to be" should be converted to
"ot eb ro ton ot eb".
8. Combine \#4 and \#7. Example: "to be or not to be" should be converted to
"eb ot ton ro eb ot".
9. Capitalize the words: ask the user to enter a phrase, capitalize its words.
Example: "the little mermaid" should be converted to "The Little Mermaid".
10. Convert to CamelCase: ask the user to enter a sentence, convert it to
camel case. Camel case LooksLikeThis. What you do is first capitalize each word
and then remove all the spaces between them. For example: "the little mermaid"
should be converted to "TheLittleMermaid".
11. Triple the numbers Redux: like \#5, but this time you have to support
numbers containing more than one digit.
