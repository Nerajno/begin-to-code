# Lesson 2.2 Exercises

For these exercises, use a string formatter whenever you are printing.

## Hello!

Ask the user for their name, and say to them "Hello, NAME!". Substitute
their name in place of NAME. Example output:

```
What's your name? Henry
Hello, Henry!
```

## How Old Are You?

Ask the user for their name and what year they were born. Use a simple
calculation to find their age. Say a greeting to them and then tell
them their age. Example output:

```
What's your name? Amanda
What year were you born? 1982
Hello, Amanda! You are 36 years old.
```

## Hello! Times 5

Hello, Henry!
Hello, Henry!
Hello, Henry!
Hello, Henry!
Hello, Henry!
```

## Hello! Count it Out

Except that, count and say the current number before each greeting.

## Price'em Apples

An apple costs $1.35. Print a table displaying the cost for 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
all the way up to 50 apples.

Display the dollar amounts in this format: $#.##.
For example `$5.50`, or `$21.50`.

You've done the exercises below before, but this time, display the dollar
amounts in this format: $#.##. For example `$5.50`, or `$21.50`.

## How Much Did You Save? Redux

You have a coupon. It says if you buy $50.00 worth of products or more,
you save 20%. If you buy less than $50.00 worth of products, you save %12.

Ask the user what is the amount of their purchase and tell them what's the
new total after the coupon is applied, and also tell them how much they saved.

*You've done this exercise before, but this time, display the dollar
amounts in this format: $#.##. For example `$5.50`, or `$21.50`.*

## Buffet: Redux

There is a buffet my family likes called Tokyo Bay. It charges $15.00 per
adult and $10.00 per child. On Tuesdays, though, kids eat free.

Write a program to ask the user:

1. How many adults are in their family?
2. How many children are in their family?
3. What day of the week is it?

Tell the user how much it will cost for the family to eat at Tokyo Bay.
