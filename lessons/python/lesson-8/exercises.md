# Lesson 8 Exercises

## Rebuild Avoid-The-Bouncing-Ball Game

Follow the lecture slides and rebuild the avoid-the-bouncing-ball game step
by step from scratch. You may use the code examples as reference, but try
to do and understand each step. If you don't understand a step, try making it
do something different or unexpected.

## Add a Bouncing Ball

Add a new, green, bouncing ball. This ball moves twice as fast as the blue ball.

## Collision Detection for Green Ball

Add collision detection code for the green ball as well.
You now need to avoid both the blue and green balls in order to not lose.

## Game Reset

When ever the player loses, reset the state of the game --- the positions of
  all the balls --- back to the initial values, and start the game again.
  This does mean that you may not see the "GAME OVER" message anymore.

## Player Triggered Game Reset

Go back to displaying the "GAME OVER" message when the player loses. When
the game is in the "GAME OVER" state, and the player hits the ENTER key (key
  code 13), reset and restart the game.

## Make Your Own Game

Here is when you get to use your creativity. Design and create your own game.
If you need some help with ideas, your instructor and classmates can help you.
