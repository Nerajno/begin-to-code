# Lesson 2.5 Exercises

## Create Your Own Pattern CheatSheet

Based on the patterns in this lecture, create your own
patterns cheatsheet. It should include the following
patterns and code examples for each:

* The Loop Counter Pattern
* The Loop and Filter Pattern
* The Accumulator Pattern
* The Accumulator and Filter Pattern

## If You're Happy and You Know It...

You will print the lyrics to the song: [If You're Happy and You Know it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You%27re_Happy_and_You_Know_It).

You have a list of the ending phrases:

```python
endings = [
  "shout/say, 'Hooray'!",
  "slap your knees!",
  "slap your legs!",
  "turn around!",
  "snap your fingers!",
  "nod your head!",
  "tap your toe!",
  "honk your nose!",
  "pat your head!"
]
```

Iterate through each one in order to print the complete lyrics of the song.

## Scores

The judges gave these scores:

```python
scores = [7, 8, 9, 10, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4]
```

Write programs to:

1. Print each score. (loop counter pattern)
2. Print each score doubled. (loop counter pattern)
3. Print all the scores in this list that are greater than 5. (loop and filter)
4. Print all the scores in this list that are odd. (loop and filter)
5. Print the total of the scores in this list. (accumulator pattern)
6. Print the total of all the scores that are greater than 5. (accumulator + filter pattern)
7. Print the total of all the scores that are odd. (accumulator + filter pattern)
8. Print the count of the number of scores in the list that are greater than 5. (accumulator + filter pattern)
9. Print the count of the number of scores in the list that are odd. (accumulator + filter pattern)

## Bonus Challenges

1. Print the average score.
2. Print the largest score. (Hint: accumulator pattern with an if statement)
3. Print the smallest score.
4. Print the total score minus the largest and the smallest score.
5. Print the average score minus the largest and smallest score.
