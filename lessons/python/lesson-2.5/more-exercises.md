# More Exercises for Lesson 2.5

## Scores

The judges gave these scores:

```python
scores = [7, 8, 9, 10, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4]
```

Write programs to:

1. Print each score. (loop counter pattern)
2. Print each score doubled. (loop counter pattern)
3. Print all the scores in this list that are greater than 5. (loop and filter)
4. Print all the scores in this list that are odd. (loop and filter)
5. Print the total of the scores in this list. (accumulator pattern)
6. Print the total of all the scores that are greater than 5. (accumulator + filter pattern)
7. Print the total of all the scores that are odd. (accumulator + filter pattern)
8. Print the count of the number of scores in the list that are greater than 5. (accumulator + filter pattern)
9. Print the count of the number of scores in the list that are odd. (accumulator + filter pattern)

## Bonus Challenges

1. Print the average score.
2. Print the largest score. (Hint: accumulator pattern with an if statement)
3. Print the smallest score.
4. Print the total score minus the largest and the smallest score.
5. Print the average score minus the largest and smallest score.
