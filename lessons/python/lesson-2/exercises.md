# Lesson 2 Exercises

## You Shall Not Pass

Ask the user to enter a password. If they entered "open sesame", print
"You shall pass", if they entered anything else, print "You shall not pass".

## Too Short to Ride

Ask the user to enter their height in inches (remember to convert it to an
  integer). If they are 48 inches or more, print "Good to go". Otherwise,
  print "You are too short to ride".

## Degree Conversion Calculator 1

Ask the user for a temperature in Fahrenheit, tell them the equivalent
temperature in Celsius.

## Degree Conversion Calculator 2

Same as the first calculator, but convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

## Degree Conversion Calculator 3

Combine the 2 previous calculators into one program. First ask them to enter
a number: either 1 or 2. If they entered 1, ask for the temperature in
Fahrenheit and convert it to Celsius. If they entered 2, ask for the
temperature in Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit.

## How Much Did You Save?

You have a coupon. If says if you buy $50.00 worth of products or more,
you save 20%. If you buy less than $50.00 worth of products, you save %12.

Ask the user what is the amount of their purchase and tell them what's the
new total after the coupon is applied, and also tell them how much they saved.

## Price of the ride

A carnival ride costs $12.00 for adults; $6 for kids (12 or under);
$7 for senior citizens (60 or older). You have to be at least 48 inches to
ride.

Write a program to ask the user for their age and then their height. If
they qualify to ride, tell them the cost of their ride. If they do not
qualify to ride, tell them that they cannot ride.

## Bonus: Buffet

There is a buffet my family likes called Tokyo Bay. It charges $15.00 per
adult and $10.00 per child. On Tuesdays, though, kids eat free.

Write a program to ask the user:

1. How many adults are in their family?
2. How many children are in their family?
3. What day of the week is it?

Tell the user how much it will cost for the family to eat at Tokyo Bay.
