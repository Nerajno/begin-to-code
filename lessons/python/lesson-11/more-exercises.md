## Lesson 11 More Exercises

**Use the Dictionary Translator pattern to solve these problems.**

1. Write a vowelSwap(string) that takes a string and returns
a new version of the string with:
  * all a's changed to i's
  * all e's changed to o's
  * all i's changed to u's
  * all o's changed to a's
  * all u's changed to e's
2. Write a `sanitizePhrase(phrase)` function. It will return a new version
of the string with profanity in the passed in phrase removed by replacing
occurrences of the f-word, s-word, and a-words with names of delicious fruit.
2. Implement the original Caesar Cipher: ROT13 --- using 13 as the key.

What is the Caesar Cipher? Read about it:

The solution should be a function called `rot13(string)` which will return
a new version of the string that is the ROT13 of the passed in string.
