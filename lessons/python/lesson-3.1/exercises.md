# Exercises for Lesson 3.1

You will use the accumulator pattern in one form or another to solve all
of the problems in this set.

Given this list of letters:

```python
letters = ['a', 'n', 't', 'i', 'd', 'i', 's', 'e', 's', 't', 'a', 'b', 'l', 'i', 's', 'h', 'm', 'e', 'n', 't', 'a', 'r', 'i', 'a', 'n', 'i', 's', 'm']
```

1. Concatenate the letters of the list into a string result and print it out.
2. Same, but remove all vowels (a, e, i, o, and u).
3. Same, but convert all vowels to uppercase.
4. Same, but:
    * Change all a's to i's
    * Change all e's to o's
    * Change all i's to u's
    * Change all o's to a's
    * Change all u's to e's
5. Collect the vowels in one result, the consonants in another. Print all the
    collected vowels and then print the consonants.
6. Same, but whenever there is a vowel, make it a double-vowel. As in: all
    "a"'s become "aa", "o"'s become "oo", etc.

Give this list of words:

```python
words = ['To', 'be', 'or', 'not', 'to', 'be']
```

6. Collect each word into a string, with a space separating each word.
7. Same, but with the words in reverse.
8. Collect each word into a new list this time (not string), with the words
reversed.
9. Same, but collect only words that are two letters long.
