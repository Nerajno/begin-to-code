# Lesson 2 Exercises

For all exercises that involve the while loop, please use the loop counter
pattern - which means that the incrementer statement that changes the value
of the counter variable should be the last statement in the loop.

## Count to n

Ask the user to enter a number n. Count starting from 0 to that number.

## Count Down

Ask the user to enter a number n. Count down from that number to zero.

## Count From and To

Ask the user to enter a start number m, and then ask them for
another number n. Count from m to n.

## Print the Odds

Ask the user to enter a start number m, and then ask them for
another number n. Print each number between m and n that's an
odd number.

Example:

```
Gimme a number m: 3
Gimme a number n: 9
3
5
7
9
```

Example 2:

```
Gimme a number m: 2
Gimme a number n: 8
3
5
7
```

## Count by 5's

Ask the user to enter a number n. Count by fives, starting from 0 to that number.

## Calculate Age

Ask the user for his name, and then the year they are born. Tell him their age.

## Tip Calculator

Take the tip calculator program you wrote in lesson 1, and instead of printing
a list of arguments, use string formatting to display text. For decimals,
display only 2 decimal points. Here is the problem again:

The user just finished a meal at a restaurant. Ask the user for:

1. the amount of the bill
2. what percentage they want to add as a tip

and then tell them

1. the tip amount, and
2. the total amount.

## Coin Counter

Rewrite the coin counter program you wrote in lesson 1
using string formatting.

The user has an assortment of coins: quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

Ask the user how many of each type of coin they have. Tell them the total monetary amount of their coins.

## Say Hi

Ask the user for his name. Ask him for a number. Say hi to the user as many
times as the number he entered.

## Say Hi 2

Same as the previous exercise. But this time scout out the count
before each greeting, example:

```
What is your name? Manoush
Gimmi a number: 5
1. Hi Manoush!!!
2. Hi Manoush!!!
3. Hi Manoush!!!
4. Hi Manoush!!!
5. Hi Manoush!!!
```

## How Much Did You Save 2

You have a coupon. If says if you buy $50.00 worth of products or more,
you save 20%. If you buy less than $50.00 worth of products, you save %12.

Count by 5's from $5 to $100. For each number - as a purchase total,
print how much the customer would have saved.

## 5 Multiplication

Ask the user for a number. Print the value of multiplying each number by
5 from 1 up to that number.

Example:

```python
Gimme a number: 5
5
10
15
20
25
```

## Multiplication Table

Ask the user for a number. Print the multiplication table up to that number.

Example:

```python
Gimme a number: 3
1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
```

*Hint: you'll need to write 2 nested while loops / 2 nested
loop counter patterns.*

## Pencil and Paper Exercise

Take one of the exercises you did in this homework set. Copy the
code onto paper. Close your computer and evaluate your program
using nothing but pencil and paper a la Python Tutor. When you are
done, rerun the program to verify that you evaluated it correctly.
